You'll need to give me some more information to help you make chicken! 

Tell me:

* **What kind of chicken dish are you making?**  (e.g., roasted chicken, fried chicken, chicken soup, chicken stir-fry) 
* **What is your desired level of difficulty?** (e.g., beginner, intermediate, advanced)
* **Do you have any dietary restrictions?** (e.g., gluten-free, vegetarian, vegan)
* **What ingredients do you have on hand?** (e.g., herbs, spices, vegetables)

Once I have this information, I can provide you with a detailed recipe and instructions.
